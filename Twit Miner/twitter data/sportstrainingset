 "90. Well worked City corner and Milner floats in a delivery which Lescott meets at the back stick but his header loops over.", 
 "85. Almost a real party goal from James Milner who moved on to his left foot and lashes a fierce effort against the upright", 
 "84. Dzeko goes for the individual spectacular goal he so craves in this game but unfortunately his effort flies wildly over Steele's bar.", 
 "MATCH SHOT: Group celebration! #cityvbarnsley #MCFC http://t.co/TKwEiudyIm", 
 "76. A Poznan breaks out, and why not?! James Milner comes on to replace hat-trick hero Carlos Tevez", 
 "74. City have reverted to three at the back as we approach the closing stages. Roberto clearly taking the opportunity to examine his options", 
 "68. That's @21LVA's last action of the game as @Razak comes on to replace him.", 
 "66. He started it and he finished it! Needed two bites of the cherry, though but David slams the rebound past Steele. City 5-0 Barnsley", 
 "65. GOAL! @21LVA! 5-0", 
 "62. Tunnicliffe bursts through the City defence and forces another good save from Pantilimon, this time with his leg. Great stop, Costel!", 
 "58. Pantilimon called into action and dives to save from Mellis. The big Romanian determined to keep another #facup cup clean sheet", 
 "53. City make a change too as @SamNasri19 makes way for @Scotty_Sinclair",

 "50. @SamNasri19 the provider for Tevez who swept home! City 4-0 Barnsley", 
 "50. HAT-TRICK FOR TEVEZ! 4-0",

 "HALF TIME: City 3-0 Barnsley. Two for Tevez either side of a Kolarov strike means the Blues are one step closer to Wembley #cityvbarnsley",

 "18. City finding their rhythm now. Tevez accelerates away from his man and then gets on the end of Nasri's cross but his header loops over", 
 "14. Always great to grab an early goal, but more so against a team with the wind in their sails. Can't see the Tykes giving up yet though",
